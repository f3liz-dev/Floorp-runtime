# Nora 0.2.0 Branch Setup

This document describes the work completed to set up the `nora-0.2.0` branch.

## ⚠️ ACTION REQUIRED

The `nora-0.2.0` branch has been created locally with all required changes, but **manual push is required** to complete the task. See "Next Steps Required" section below.

## Steps Completed

1. ✅ Added `upstream` remote pointing to `@Floorp-Projects/Floorp-runtime`
2. ✅ Fetched the `nora-0.2.0` branch from upstream
3. ✅ Created local `nora-0.2.0` branch from `upstream/nora-0.2.0`
4. ✅ Copied all `.github` files from `origin/main` branch to `nora-0.2.0` branch
5. ✅ Committed changes with message: "Copy .github files from main branch"

## Current Status

The `nora-0.2.0` branch is ready locally with all the required changes:
- Branch: `nora-0.2.0`
- Commit: `b7d6b247b9` (Copy .github files from main branch)
- Parent: `8a2aa17dfc` (Initial commit from upstream)
- Files added: 267 files in `.github/` directory

## Next Steps Required

The `nora-0.2.0` branch needs to be pushed to origin. Due to authentication constraints in the automated environment, manual intervention is required to push the branch.

### Option 1: Use the provided script

```bash
./push-nora-branch.sh
```

### Option 2: Manual push

```bash
git push -u origin nora-0.2.0
```

### Option 3: Using GitHub CLI

```bash
gh auth login
git push -u origin nora-0.2.0
```

## Verification

To verify the branch is ready:

```bash
# Check the branch exists locally
git branch | grep nora-0.2.0

# View the commit
git log nora-0.2.0 --oneline -3

# Check .github files
git ls-tree -r nora-0.2.0 -- .github/ | wc -l  # Should show 267
```

## Summary of Changes

The nora-0.2.0 branch includes:
- Complete `.github/` directory structure from the main branch
- Workflows for CI/CD (build, test, PGO profiling, etc.)
- Branding assets (Floorp official, Floorp daylight, Noraneko unofficial)
- Patches for packaging and upstream integration
- Build configuration and scripts
